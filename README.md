# Shopping

Hi! This is my e-commerce website. 
This is a microservice project with Eureka as service registery, and api gateway.
This project currently has product service for project creation, search, update and deletion,
and customer service for user creation, details extraction, update and deletion.

TODO:
1. Implement the functionality that customers should be able to save products to their favourite list
2. Customers are able to have multiple addresses
3. Implement circuit breaker
4. Dockerize the application
